# Flexible ANalytic Chemical Evolution

FANC-E is an analytic one-zone chemical evolution code. It implements the Weinberg, Andrews, & Freudenburg (2017) analytic solution for a constant, exponential declining, or linear-exponential (delayed tau) star formation history. It also implements a flexible, two-parameter star formation history proportional to $\propto(1-exp(-t/tau1))*exp(-t/tau2)$, which rises linearly on a timescale tau1 and then falls exponentially on a timescale tau2.
