# Flexible ANalytic Chemical Evolution

FANC-E is an analytic one-zone chemical evolution code. It implements the Weinberg, Andrews, & Freudenburg (2017) analytic solution for a constant, exponential declining, or linear-exponential (delayed tau) star formation history. It also implements a flexible, two-parameter star formation history $\propto(1-e^{-t/\tau_1})e^{-t/\tau_2}$, which rises linearly on a timescale $\tau_1$ and then falls exponentially on a timescale $\tau_2$ for $\tau_1>\tau_2>0$.
